# Manually Sortable d3 Barchart
This is my attempt to make a manually sortable barchart in d3.
That is, you can drag and move any bars to any place.   
A live demo is available [here](https://bl.ocks.org/Lulkafe/097a34f373cfe70f3acec3f4c5c69f34).
In order to focus on the core functionality and make the implementation simple, y axis is intentionally not added.
Hope this helps someone to get an idea of how to implement such a barchart.

Thanks!
